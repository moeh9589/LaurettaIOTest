I chose to complete problems 1 and 4. 
I completed problem 1 using python. I created a React app for problem 4.

To test different images for problem 1, I created a variable inside my main function that I could change based on which directory I want to use. For example,
if I wanted to test the 'Simple' image, I would just change the variable in line 65 to "simple". The result gets sent to "merged_image.jpg" in the parent directory. This image gets modified when another instance gets created."# LaurettaIOTest"
